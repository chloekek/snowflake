   action
      A description of how to build some outputs given some inputs.

   action cache
      A mapping from build hashes to output hashes.

   action graph
      A collection of actions and the dependencies between them.

   artifact
      An output which is made available to the user.

   build file
      A script that defines a collection of rules in a single package.

   build hash
      A hash of the configuration and dependencies of an action.

   build log
      Any data an action writes to stdout or stderr.
      The build log of an action is displayed when the action fails,
      or when the action produces warnings (even in case of a cache hit).

   configuration
      The properties of an action that are dependency-invariant.
      Which properties these are depends on the type of action.
      For actions that have inputs, any source file inputs
      are considered part of the action's configuration.

   dependency
      An output of an action used by another action.
      An action cannot be performed until all its dependencies are built.

   input
      A dependency or source file.

   lint action
      An action that produces no outputs.
      Lint actions are only performed for their build logs;
      more specifically for any warnings they might produce.

   output
      A file generated by an action.
      Outputs can be used as artifacts
      or as dependencies of other actions.

   output cache
      A content-addressed store of outputs.

   output hash
      The hash of an output, used as the key of that output in the output cache.

   package
      A collection of rules corresponding to
      a particular directory in the source tree.

   scratch directory
      A temporary directory in which the container
      of a *run command* action is located.

   scratches directory
      A subdirectory of the state directory
      in which scratch directories are located.

   source file
      A file from the source tree used directly by an action.
      Unlike dependencies, source files are not outputs of actions.

   source root
      The topmost directory of a source tree.

   source tree
      A directory hierarchy in which build files and source files are located.

   state directory
      A directory, often at the path ``.snowflake``,
      which contains on-disk state pertaining to a project.
      Most state persists across build system invocations.

   warning
      A state that causes the build log of an action
      to be displayed even if the action succeeds.
